# my-library

ABOUT

This is my little library, inspired by my newfound love for reading. This site is capable of adding books that I've read to "My Library" and books I'd like to read to "Books To Read". The site is served with Flask, the database uses SQLAlchemy, and the forms are created with WTForms. 

IMPROVEMENTS

I would like to create additional functionalities, such as a notes page and a feature that allows books to be transfered from "Books To Read" to "My Library". Also, edit.html is unable to read external CSS, so there is inline CSS. This discrepancy needs to be fixed.
